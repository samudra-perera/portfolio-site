# Portfolio Site

I finally got around to rebuilding my portfolio site. My first time around, did not go as well as I hoped (2 years ago). I was heavily inspired by Rory Flint's simple website design for my own. It was straight to the point and everything I wanted out of my own portfolio site.

## Tech Stack

This site was built using TypeScript, React, and Vite with Tailwind used to style the frontend.

## Something Interesting

All the Projects and Writing pages are written in markdown then rendered into HTML with tailwind styles by the Markdown.tsx component. This was done using [markdown-to-jsx](https://markdown-to-jsx.quantizor.dev/).
