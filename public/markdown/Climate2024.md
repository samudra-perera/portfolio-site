## Purpose

The purpose of the hackathon was to tackle pressing climate issues with the use of technology. Topics included drought mitigation strategies, snowfall cleanup, and globl warming.

## Problem Statement

Estimate optimal cooling station locations for the City of Toronto based on summertime hot days in the future (2071 to 2100) using downscaled CanESM5 data.

## Results

Based on the findings from our model, we chose to place cooling centers where there were no existing solutions, and that overlaid with low socio-economic areas. For our solution, we identified key locations owned by the City of Toronto that would be converted to makeshift cooling centers in these high risk areas.

### Something Interesting

Climate models take a HUGE amount of data and can [take weeks if not months to model.](https://theconversation.com/climate-models-can-run-for-months-on-supercomputers-but-my-new-algorithm-can-make-them-ten-times-faster-229041#:~:text=The%20simulations%20take%20time%2C%20frequently,the%20fight%20against%20climate%20change.) In order for us to model the City of Toronto's climate forecast, we took an existing global climate model then downscaled the data to fit our region.

### Shout out to the squad

Huge shoutout to my teammates: Mevan Solanga, Asli Bese, and Peter Angelinos!
